Some investigations have proposed good levels of folic acid may be related to lower risk of esophageal, stomach, and ovarian cancers, but the benefits of folic acid against cancer may depend on when it is taken and on individual conditions.

The low [[dihydrofolate reductase]] activity in the liver of humans compared to other animals and so the low conversion of folic acid into its active derivatives might be due to the control of this enzyme by transcription factors, such as [[E2F-1]] involved in cell proliferation. It has been suggested "the low level of DHFR, and the other proteins under the control of E2F-1, in humans may have evolved to hinder the development of cancer. If this is the case, other animals with slow tissue turnover rates, possibly related to long life span, might also have low DHFR activity."<ref name="Bailey"/>

===Antifolates===
{{Main|Antifolate}}
Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide.<ref name="Oldref_2"/> Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. The [[antifolate]] [[methotrexate]] is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form of THF from the inactive dihydrofolate (DHF). However, methotrexate can be toxic,<ref name="Oldref_46">{{cite journal | author=Rubio IT, Cao Y, Hutchins LF, Westbrook KC, Klimberg VS | title=Effect of glutamine on methotrexate efficacy and toxicity | journal=Annals of Surgery | volume=227 | issue=5 | year=1998 | pages=772–8 | pmid=9605669 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199805000-00018 | pmc=1191365}}</ref><ref name="Oldref_47">{{cite journal | author=Wolff JE, Hauch H, Kuhl J, Egeler RM, Jurgens H | title=Dexamethasone increases hepatotoxicity of MTX in children with brain tumors | journal=Anticancer Research | volume=18 | issue=4B | year=1998 | pages=2895–9 | pmid=9713483}}</ref><ref name="Oldref_48">{{cite journal | author=Kepka L, De Lassence A, Ribrag V, Gachot B, Blot F, Theodore C, Bonnay M, Korenbaum C, Nitenberg G | title=Successful rescue in a patient with high dose methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity and acute renal failure | journal=Leukemia & Lymphoma | volume=29 | issue=1–2 | year=1998 | pages=205–9 | pmid=9638991 | doi = 10.3109/10428199809058397}}</ref>

There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. The supplement of folinic acid in patients undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give cells dividing less rapidly enough folate to maintain normal cell functions. The amount of folate given will be depleted by rapidly dividing cells (cancer) very fast and so will not negate the effects of methotrexate.

In any case, it is important for older adults to be aware of the relationship between folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, because they are at greater risk of having a B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

==Dietary fortification==
[[Image:GrainProducts.jpg|right|thumb|In the USA many grain products are fortified with folic acid.]]
{{See also|Food fortification}}
Since the discovery of the link between insufficient folic acid and [[neural tube defects]], governments and health organizations worldwide have made recommendations concerning folic acid ''[[dietary supplement|supplementation]]'' for women intending to become [[Pregnancy|pregnant]].

This has led to the introduction in many countries of ''fortification'', where folic acid is added to flour with the intention of  benefiting all from the associated rise in blood folate levels. This is controversial, with issues having been raised concerning individual liberty {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, and the masking effect of folate fortification on [[pernicious anaemia]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency). However, several western countries now fortify their flour, along with a number of Middle Eastern countries and [[Indonesia]]. [[Mongolia]] and a number of [[Soviet Union|former Soviet republics]] are among those having widespread voluntary fortification; about five more countries (including [[Morocco]], the first African country) have agreed, but not yet implemented, fortification. To date, no [[European Union|EU]] country has yet mandated fortification.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Russell A  |title=The UK campaign on folic acid and flour fortification |journal=Cerebrospinal Fluid Res. |volume=3 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S33  |year=2006 |doi=10.1186/1743-8454-3-S1-S33 |pmc=1716791}}</ref>

Folates can be produced by engineering ''Lactococcus lactis'' strains using a rodent depletion-repletion bioassay, and the bioavailabilities of these folates are comparable with those of commercial folic acid currently being used for food fortification.<ref name="pmid19931414" /> These engineered folates can potentially help alleviate the effects of folate deficiency in the diet.<ref name="pmid19931414" /> Hematologic studies show an improvement in megaloblastic anemia after the addition of ''L. lactis'' strains; this again suggests lactic acid bacteria can potentially reverse some of the harm done by folate deficiency by acting as an essential, bioavailable vitamin.<ref name="pmid19931414">{{cite journal |author=Leblanc JG, Sybesma W, Starrenburg M, ''et al.''  |title=Supplementation with engineered Lactococcus lactis improves the folate status in deficient rats |journal=Nutrition |volume= 26|issue= 7–8|pages=  835–41|year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19931414 |doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.023}}</ref>

===Effects of fortification and plasma folate and homocysteine levels===
A study has shown folate fortification will substantially increase in folate status, in particular, for the elderly.  In the study group, the subjects that did not use vitamin supplements has increased folate concentrations of 4.6&nbsp;ng/mL to 10.0&nbsp;ng/mL (11 to 23 nmol/L) (P<0.001) from the base-line visit to the follow-up visit.  The prevalence of low folate concentrations (<3&nbsp;ng/mL [7 nmol/L]) decreased from 22.0% to 1.7% (P< 0.001). The mean total homocysteine concentration has decreased from a value of 10.1 µmol/L to 9.4 µmol/L during this period (P<0.001), while the prevalence of high homocysteine concentrations (>13 µmol/L) has been reduced from 18.7% to 9.8% (P<0.001). To further clarify the study methods, there were no statistically significant changes in concentrations of folate or homocysteine for the control group.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacques PF, Selhub J, Bostom AG, Wilson PW, Rosenberg IH  |title=The effect of folic acid fortification on plasma folate and total homocysteine concentrations |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=340 |issue=19 |pages=1449–54  |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10320382 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199905133401901}}</ref>

====Supplementation promotion in Canada====
According to a Canadian survey, 58% of women said they took a folic acid containing multivitamin or a folic acid supplement as early as three months before becoming pregnant.  Women in higher income households and with more years of school education are using more folic acid supplements before pregnancy.  Women with planned pregnancies and who are over the age of 25 are more likely to use folic acid supplement Canadian public health efforts are focused on promoting awareness of the importance of folic acid supplementation for all women of childbearing age and decreasing socio-economic inequalities by providing practical folic acid support to vulnerable groups of women.<ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/>

As a result of the folic acid fortification program, fortified foods have become a major source of folic acid in the American diet. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] used data from 23 birth defect registries covering about half of United States births, and extrapolated their findings to the rest of the country.  These data indicate since the addition of folic acid in grain-based foods as mandated by the FDA, the rate of neural tube defects dropped by 25% in the United States.<ref name="Oldref_57">{{cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title=Spina bifida and anencephaly before and after folic acid mandate—United States, 1995–1996 and 1999–2000 | journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume=53 | issue=17 | year=2004 | pages=362–5 | pmid=15129193}}</ref> The results of folic acid fortification on the rate of neural tube defects in [[Canada]] have also been positive, showing a 46% reduction in prevalence of NTDs;<ref>{{cite journal| author=De Wals P, Tairou F, Van Allen MI, Uh SH, Lowry RB, Sibbald B, Evans JA, Van den Hof MC, Zimmer P, Crowley M, Fernandez B, Lee NS &amp; Niyonsenga T |year=2007 |title=Reduction in neural-tube defects after folic acid fortification in Canada|journal=N Engl J Med| pmid=17625125|volume=357| issue=2|pages=135–142| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067103}}</ref> the magnitude of reduction was proportional to the prefortification rate of NTDs, essentially removing geographical variations in rates of NTDs seen in [[Canada]] before fortification.

==Future directions for research==
*Identifying polymorphisms or mutations in genes involved in the synthesis of thymidylate, purines, regulatory proteins, or substrates involved in folate and homocysteine metabolism, such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, rather than simply focusing on 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase as the main cause .{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*Direct and indirect evaluation of the adverse effects of greatly increased folic acid intakes
*Human studies looking into whether folate will interfere with the effectiveness of antifolate treatments and the possibility that it may support cancer growth.<ref name="Smith" />
*More epidemiologic and clinical studies need to be done on human tumor samples to fully understand the role of folate receptor alpha in tumor etiology, progression, and patient survival.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kelemen | first1 = LE | title = The role of folate receptor alpha in cancer development, progression and treatment: cause, consequence or innocent bystander? | journal = International journal of cancer.
